   <h1 class="songTitle">Where is the love?</h1>
   <p class="Lyrics">Lyrics:<br><br>

 People killin' people dyin'<br>
 Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'<br>
 Can you practice what you preachin'?<br>
 Would you turn the other cheek again?<br>
 Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on<br>
 Can't we all just get along?<br>
 Father, father, father help us<br>
 Send some guidance from above<br>
 'Cause people got me, got me questioning<br><br>


 what's going on with the world, momma?<br>
 people living like they ain't got no mommas<br>
 I think they all distracted by the drama<br>
 And attracted to the trauma, mamma<br>
 I think they don't understand the concept<br>
 Or the meaning of karma<br>
 Overseas, yeah, they trying to stop terrorism<br>
 Over here on the streets the police shoot the people<br>
 Put the bullets in 'em<br>
 But if you only got love for your own race<br>
 Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate<br>
 And to discriminate only generates hate<br>
 And when you hate then you're bound to get irate<br>
 Madness is what you demonstrate<br>
 And that's exactly how hate works and operates<br>
 Man, we gotta set it straight<br>
 Take control of your mind and just meditate<br>
 And let your soul just gravitate to the love<br>
 So the whole world celebrate it<br>

<h1 class="songTitle">Rock that body</h1>
<p class="Lyrics">
  Lyrics:<br><br>
  When you comin' up in the spot,<br>
Don't bring nothin' we call pink dot,<br>
'Cause we running around the clock,<br>
Hit the lights and then turn them off,<br>
If you bring that don't make you soft,<br>
Like the jungle we run the block,<br>
No one rollin' the way we rock!<br><br>
I want I wanna rock right now<br>
I want I wanna rock right now<br>
I want I wanna rock right nooow<br>
I wanna dance, I wanna dance in the light<br>
I wanna rock, I wanna rock yo body,<br>
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride,<br>
Up in the music & rock yo body right,<br>
